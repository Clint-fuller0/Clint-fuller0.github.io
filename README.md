This is my introductory page for my GitHub account! 
I will gradually be adding to it throughout my time in my current Full Stack Development course, as well as afterwards as I pursue a career in the field!
I am excited to eventually make this page much more complicated with the things I learn in this class and add additional repositories to my GitHub portfolio.
